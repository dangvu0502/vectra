# Vectra Knowledge Provision Feedback (Post-Enhancement Plan)

This summary assesses the enhanced Vectra system's current ability to provide knowledge for LLM utilization, based on implemented features and testing.

*   **Overall Picture:** Vectra now functions as a graph-aware knowledge system, capable of understanding document structure and synthesizing information from multiple related parts, offering richer context than basic vector retrieval.

*   **Effectiveness Rating (for LLM Utilization):** Estimated at **~80-85%** for providing relevant, contextual, and synthesized information, particularly from structured documents like developer docs.

*   **Key Implemented Strengths:**
    *   Structural graph creation (understanding document outlines).
    *   LLM-powered answer synthesis.
    *   Improved context-aware chunking.

*   **Planned Improvements (Next Steps):**
    *   Maturing the LLM-generated semantic graph (relationships like "explains", "cites"; entities) to enable deeper conceptual understanding. The infrastructure is in place, but practical effectiveness needs further validation.

*   **Best Use Cases:**
    *   Querying structured documents (e.g., developer docs, technical manuals).
    *   Answering complex questions requiring cross-sectional synthesis.
    *   Navigating documentation structurally.

*   **Tips for Utilization:**
    *   Use specific queries targeting the needed information.
    *   **Enable graph search (`enableGraphSearch=true`)** to leverage structural and semantic context.
    *   Adjust `graphDepth` as needed for broader context.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Semantic graph quality is not yet fully validated.
    *   Inherent limitations in automated chunking/LLM reasoning persist.
    *   Effectiveness depends heavily on source document quality and structure.

*   **Future Direction:** Continued development and validation of the semantic graph features will further enhance conceptual understanding and reasoning capabilities, making Vectra an even more powerful knowledge base.

## Refactor Plan Progress (Tracking `server-refactor-plan.md`)

**Status as of:** 2025-04-14

**Priority 1: Documentation & Non-Code Changes**
- [x] Add top-level `docs/` folder (exists)
- [x] Add high-level project README (exists, reviewed)
- [x] Add per-module README files (Auth, Collections, File, Config, Database)
- [ ] Add comments and high-level docstrings to existing files (Ongoing/Future)
- [x] Document environment variables in `.env.example`

**Priority 2: Centralization of Constants & Config**
- [x] Centralize PG table names in `src/database/constants.ts`
- [x] Centralize ArangoDB collection names in `src/config/constants.ts`
- [x] Refactor Schemas, Migrations, Seeds, Query files (`.queries.ts`, `.search.queries.ts`) to use constants
- [ ] Refactor Service/Controller/Other files to use constants (Ongoing/Future)
- [x] Ensure ArangoDB config uses `env` (Verified in `arangodb/client.ts`)

**Priority 3: Utility Functions & Error Handling**
