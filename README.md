# Vectra

Vectra, built with TypeScript, helps you build and query your own knowledge base. It features a server (API, file/collection management, chunking, embedding, and graph operations using Postgres, ArangoDB, Redis, and BullMQ) and a modern web client for managing and querying your data.

**Note:** This project is currently under heavy development and may contain bugs. Use with caution.
